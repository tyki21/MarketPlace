## For ITMD 413 Project One

Welcome to the MarketPlace where you will be able to buy, sell, and trade any handmade items that are in your possession. This will be a great way to clean out your stash or finally get pieces of a project you've been putting off since who knows when.

This web application was created using Ruby 2.4.1 and Rails 5.1

As of right now in order to access this you will need to use localhost:3000 on your device. If you have any questions on complications please feel free to contact me via e-mail at tolivest@hawk.iit.edu
